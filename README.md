RECURSION :
---------------

In Math recursion defined as relationship defined by itself 
Simply a recursion technique is depending on a function that call it self repeatedly without abreak that it need an exit condition which called as (basecase)
Some of sorting and searching algorithms depending on Recursion as (quicksort , mergesort , binary search......).

We can say it is a recursion techqnique where you..divide your problem to the simplest possible case >>> basecase
		

QuickSort :

	How to sort a collection of (n) of elements?	
	1. Pick a pivot.
	2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
	3. Call quicksort recursively on the two sub-arrays.
